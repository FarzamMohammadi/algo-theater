> A visual stage for algorithms and data structures. Watch them perform, step by step.

## About

A free, static site for visualizing algorithms and data structures. Built for visual learners who understand best when they can see concepts in action.

## Algorithm Coverage

Full list of planned algorithms organized by category and difficulty:

**[comprehensive_algorithms_list.md](./comprehensive_algorithms_list.md)**

## Features (Planned)

- **Step-by-step playback** — Pause, rewind, and step through each operation
- **Speed control** — Slow it down to understand, speed it up once you've got it
- **Complexity info** — Time and space complexity displayed for each algorithm
- **Mobile-friendly** — Learn anywhere
- **Fully static** — Runs entirely in your browser, works offline

## Roadmap


- [x] Algorithm list and categorization
- [ ] Core site structure
- [ ] Sorting visualizations
- [ ] Searching visualizations
- [ ] Graph visualizations
- [ ] Tree visualizations
- [ ] Dynamic programming visualizations
- [ ] Backtracking visualizations
- [ ] String algorithm visualizations

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's:

- Adding a new algorithm visualization
- Improving an existing visualization
- Fixing bugs
- Enhancing documentation

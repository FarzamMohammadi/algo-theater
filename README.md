# 🎭 algo-theater

> A visual stage for algorithms and data structures. Watch them perform, step by step.

## About

**algo-theater** is a free, open-source visual learning platform for algorithms and data structures. Built for visual learners who understand best when they can *see* concepts in action.

No dry textbook explanations. No static diagrams. Just clean, animated visualizations that map directly to how these algorithms actually work.

---

## Why This Exists

Learning algorithms from code alone is hard. You read the logic, you trace through it mentally, but something doesn't *click*. 

For visual learners, seeing is understanding. Watching a sorting algorithm swap elements in real-time, or seeing Dijkstra's algorithm flood across a graph — that's when it finally makes sense.

**algo-theater** brings every major algorithm to the stage, one visualization at a time.

## What's Inside

**230+ algorithms and data structures**, organized by category and sorted by difficulty within each category.

| **Searching** | Binary Search, Jump Search, Interpolation Search |
| **Graph Traversal** | BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, A* Search |
| **Shortest Path** | Floyd-Warshall, Johnson's Algorithm |
| **Minimum Spanning Tree** | Prim's, Kruskal's, Borůvka's |
| **Tree Operations** | BST Insert/Delete, AVL Rotations, Red-Black Trees |
| **Tree Traversals** | Pre-order, In-order, Post-order, Level-order |
| **Heap Operations** | Heapify, Insert, Extract, Build Heap |
| **Advanced Trees** | Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree, Trie, B-Tree |
| **String Matching** | KMP, Rabin-Karp, Boyer-Moore, Z Algorithm |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Knapsack, LCS, Edit Distance, Coin Change |
| **Backtracking** | N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Rat in a Maze, Knight's Tour |
| **Greedy** | Activity Selection, Huffman Coding, Fractional Knapsack |
| **Divide & Conquer** | Merge Sort, Quick Select, Closest Pair of Points |

## Philosophy

1. **Clarity over cleverness** — Every visualization should be immediately understandable
2. **Progressive complexity** — Start simple, build up
3. **Respect the learner** — No dumbing down, no unnecessary complexity
4. **Accessible to all** — Free, fast, works everywhere

## License

MIT — Use it, learn from it, build on it.

## Acknowledgments

Built for every visual learner who stared at pseudocode wondering *"but what does it actually do?"*

Now you can watch it happen.
